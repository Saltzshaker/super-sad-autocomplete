# Super Sad Autocomplete

Super Sad Googles is an autocomplete search platform populated only with users’ saddest, weirdest, most disturbed searches. The goal of searching Super Sad Googles is not to find an answer, but to find (advertisement-free!) solace in the queries of fellow weirdos. 


## Sources of Autocomplete Items:
1. Anonymous queries used with permission from a Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BKbl9iJ4jBJPO24S5VwxgTJ_9Y-4kP7lj2ASBUXXDxY/edit

2. Ad hoc scraping of Google's autocomplete for specific keystrokes

3. Reddit & Quora

## Autocomplete Code:
Autocomplete base from Trevor Raye's Demonstration of a fully accessible autocomplete/search component in vanilla JavaScript. Based on the WAI-ARIA authoring practices 1.1: https://codepen.io/saltzshaker/pen/LqGOmR. https://codepen.io/trevoreyre/pen/bvwOeL

The autocomplete currently uses a simple matching algorithm.
