2. Ad hoc scraping of Google's autocomplete for specific keystokes

3. Reddit & Quora

## Autocomplete Code:
Autocomplete base from Trevor Raye's Demonstration of a fully accessible autocomplete/search component in vanilla JavaScript. Based on the WAI-ARIA authoring practices 1.1: https://codepen.io/saltzshaker/pen/LqGOmR. https://codepen.io/trevoreyre/pen/bvwOeL

The autocomplete currently uses a simple matching algorithm.
